user must enter/create an employee object
-this object will be a python object
-the user will be prompted to submit an excel of employee info with pandas
	> the info provided will be formatted as follows:
		*last name, first name
		*day of the week availability with hours
		*employee_id

a relational database of employees and their respective shifts will exist
-this will be created through a python script
	>the python script will have the constraints for what to create 	for a row's time based on the entered availability parameters 	and the requested hours parameter read in from the excel
		*this means that the python script will dictate what to 		populate a row with, not SQL


once all information is processed from the backend, a scheduling algo will need to be generated from chatGPT based on the information provided from the user
-this algo will be integrated into the program after aggregating all of the employee's data correctly


the scheduling algo will put an excel sheet together with pandas using a python script in order to display the work week's schedule
